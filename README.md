# Delay/Chorus
Delay/Chorus in C++ (AU)

This is a Audio Unity (AU) Delay Chorus that I have developed during my C++ Output-Kandeze course. 
It works on MAC only for now.

- Itnstallation
Download it and place it whithin the following path:
~/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/Components

It will appear within your DAW under yourcompany/KadenzeAudioPlugin

The plug has a preset saving manager system, so that you can save your own presets.
Because it is a prototype, you may experience craches, however relunching the device resets it

Enjoy!
