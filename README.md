# Delay/Chorus
Delay/Chorus in C++ (AU)

This is an Audio Unity (AU) Delay Chorus that I have developed during my C++ Output-Kandeze course. It works on MAC only for now.

Installation Download it and place it within the following path: ~/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/Components
It will appear within your DAW under yourcompany/KadenzeAudioPlugin

The plug has a preset saving manager system so that you can save your own presets. Because it is a prototype, you may experience crashes, however relaunching the device resets it

Enjoy!
